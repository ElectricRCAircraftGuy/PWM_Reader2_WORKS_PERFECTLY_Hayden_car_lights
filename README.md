-not an ongoing project, just a quick proof-of-concept to read an RC PWM signal

See also [my Stack Overflow answer here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/76479768/4561887).

This code reads an RC PWM control signal, which is complicated, and blinks an LED at a rate proportional to the throttle setting. 

[Here's the core code](https://github.com/ElectricRCAircraftGuy/PWM_Reader2_WORKS_PERFECTLY_Hayden_car_lights/blob/master/PWM_Reader2_WORKS_PERFECTLY_Hayden_car_lights.ino).
